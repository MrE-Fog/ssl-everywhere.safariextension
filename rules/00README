<!-- 
This directory contains web site rewriting rules from the
HTTPS Everywhere software, available from
https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere. These rules are used
as the basis for SSL Everywhere rules.

The HTTPS Everywhere rules were contributed to the project by 
users and aim to enable routine secure access to as many 
different web sites as possible.  They are automatically 
transformed into SSL Everywhere rules and installed together 
with the HTTPS Everywhere software.  The presence of these 
rules does not mean that an HTTPS Everywhere user accessed, 
or intended to access, any particular web site.

For information about how to create additional HTTPS Everywhere
rewriting rules to add support for new sites, please see
https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/rulesets

New rules will be added to SSL Everywhere shortly after they
are added to HTTPS Everywhere.
