[SSL Everywhere](https://www.nearinfinity.com/home/ssl-everywhere.html) is a Safari web browser extension developed by [Near Infinity](https://www.nearinfinity.com) to force SSL encryption for many of today's popular websites. The extension leverages work done by the [Electronic Frontier Foundation's]() (EFF) [HTTPS Everywhere]() extension for Firefox.

Contributing
============

You'll need a basic understanding of how to develop extensions for the Safari web browser. Apple has excellent documentation that should [get you started](http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/Tools/Conceptual/SafariExtensionGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html) quickly. Then, just follow the instructions below to get the source code and start contributing.

### Forking the project into your github account
You can fork this project within github, as described on [help.github.com](http://help.github.com/forking/). This fork will show up on your own github profile, and can be checked out to your local machine. You don't need a webserver on there, or run any project-specific scripts.

### Updating your project fork
You should update your own repository every now and then from "upstream" (the original repository), to ensure you make any changes on the most recent version of files. See "[Pulling in upstream changes](http://help.github.com/forking/#pulling_in_upstream_changes)" on help.github.com.

### Committing changes back through "pull requests"
See "[Pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)" on help.github.com.

### Merging in "pull requests"
This only needs to be done by maintainers of the original repository. Merging back pull requests can either be done [straight on github](http://github.com/chillu/silverstripe-doc-restructuring/forkqueue) (for simple cases), or through git pull commands (see [guide](http://github.com/guides/pull-requests)).
